            At Whype, your privacy is of utmost importance to us. As a free AI image background remover, we are committed to protecting your personal information and ensuring transparency about how your data is handled. This Privacy Policy outlines the types of information we collect, how we use it, and the measures we take to safeguard your privacy.

            <strong>1. Information We Collect</strong><br />
            Whype does not require you to create an account or provide personal information to use our core background removal service. When you upload an image, it is processed securely on our servers. We do not store your images or any personal data associated with them. Any metadata or information contained within the images is not retained after processing. We may collect non-personal, aggregated data such as browser type, device information, and usage statistics to improve our service and monitor performance, but this data cannot be used to identify you.
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>2. Use of Cookies</strong><br />
            Whype may use cookies and similar technologies to enhance your experience, remember your preferences, and analyze site traffic. These cookies do not collect personal information and can be disabled in your browser settings. Disabling cookies may affect certain features of the website.

          <p>
            <strong>3. How We Use Your Information</strong><br />
            The limited information we collect is used solely to operate, maintain, and improve Whype. We do not sell, rent, or share your personal data with third parties. We may use aggregated, anonymized data for analytics and to understand how users interact with our service, but this data cannot be traced back to any individual user.
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>4. Data Security</strong><br />
            We implement industry-standard security measures to protect your data from unauthorized access, alteration, disclosure, or destruction. All image processing is performed using secure protocols, and images are deleted immediately after processing. While we strive to protect your information, please be aware that no method of transmission over the internet or electronic storage is 100% secure.
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>5. Third-Party Links</strong><br />
